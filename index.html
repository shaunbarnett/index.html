    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>
        My most recent experience has been as an IT engineer, although I have experience in a variety of roles. I have always been interested in software engineering. I recently join the Hyperion software engineering bootcamp where I learned a variety of skills including functions, object orientated programming and more. Software engineering is my  passion and  I am fascinated by coding, learning new skills and I am excited about the challenges presented by the industry. I am a motivated team player with excellent customer service skills and I am eager to prove myself as an asset to your organisation.
